# Create-a-blog-using-Django

# Description

I have used django to create a blog on reading and uploading articles. This blog make users feel free and comfort to read and upload the articles. HTML, CSS and JavaScript have
been used for the frontend.

# Implementation

Various applications like djangonautic, articles, and accounts have been used to create the blog. Djangonautic is default application of django, whereas articles and accounts
are user defined applications. A request will be made by url and it fires a function in views file and it renders the HTML template and gives response to the users using HTTP
response. Now coming to articles, we will be creating the URL's for article list and article details. we will be using models which is a class in python and represents the data
in a tabular form. Django ORM is used to interact with the table. Now coming to accounts, we will be creating the URL's for Login, Signup, and .... e.t.c., JavaScript is used
for the validation. A base html has been created which is used in all other html files. If we need to make any changes, so no need to make changes in every file, Instead make
change in base file. So this is the full overview of this project.
